# python-sparse-category-indices

An implementation of "sparse category indices" from (Madani and Connor, 2008), [Large-Scale Many-Class Learning](http://omadani.net/pubs/2008/many_class_SDM08.pdf).

This software has been tested under Python 2.6x. It
may not work under other 2.x versions of the Python interpreter.

You need to have 'hotshot' installed for profiling.

For options, run [from top-level directory]:

`python ./runff.py -h`

All of the magic happens in ./ffclassifier.py

To make this work, you need to write a feature extractor that
writes features of the form:

***class featname1(:activation1) ... featnameN(:activationN)***

to file, where __class__ is an output class string, __featnameX__ are 
string feature names and __activationX__ are real-valued feature 
activations (not needed for Boolean features).

Here's an example of how to run the classifier (using the toy 
program 'lm.py' -- a very simple, example discriminative language modelling
use):


  `$ wget http://norvig.com/big.txt`  
  `$ head -10000 big.txt | sed 's/\([.,?\!\";:]\)/ \1 /g' | python ./lm.py --train --context=2 > /tmp/fts`  
  `$ python runff.py -m /tmp/mod -f /tmp/fts -b -t -i 2`  
  Training on data set /tmp/fts: iteration 1  
  MRR for iteration 1: 0.234908631699  
  R-1 recall for iteration 1: 0.189187471472  
  R-5 recall for iteration 1: 0.292782980985  
  Training on data set /tmp/fts: iteration 2  
  MRR for iteration 2: 0.876870852508  
  R-1 recall for iteration 2: 0.785523206434  
  R-5 recall for iteration 2: 0.989831115631  
  total time in seconds 69  
  ave. per-iteration time in seconds 34  
  `$ echo "elementary _ dear Watson" | python ./lm.py --test --model /tmp/mod --context=2`  
  elementary {my} dear Watson
  
  Have fun!
